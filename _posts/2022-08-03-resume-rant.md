One of my bigget personal resume red flags is a list of languages and/or tools paired with some sort of rating scale (1-10, 0-5 stars, etc).

A junior developer hasn't seen enough to know where their skills rank in the real world, so these rankings end up being lies.

A senior developer should be self aware enough to know where their skills actually rank, and any item that would end up with a high ranking should be highlighted elsewhere in the resume.
